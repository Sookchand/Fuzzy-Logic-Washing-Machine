# Fuzzy Logic Washing Machine Controller
This project is a Fuzzy Logic based solution to determine the amount of time needed to clean a room. The solution uses Scikit-Fuzzy, a Python library for fuzzy logic, to determine the amount of time needed to clean a room based on the dirtiness and load of the room. The solution takes two inputs, dirtiness and load, and outputs the amount of time needed to clean the room.

## Tech Stack

The tech stack used for this solution is Python and Scikit-Fuzzy.

## Documentation
Documentation for the Scikit-Fuzzy library can be found at: https://pythonhosted.org/scikit-fuzzy/index.html.
## Lessons Learned
- This project taught me how to use Scikit-Fuzzy to create a fuzzy logic based solution. 
- I learned how to define the inputs and outputs, create membership functions, and view the results. 
- I also learned how to use the Scikit-Fuzzy library to create a fuzzy logic based solution.
